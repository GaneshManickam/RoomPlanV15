**Project Name:** RoomPlanV15  

**Description:**  
RoomPlanV15 is a sample iOS project built using **UIKit** and Apple's **RoomPlan API**. This project demonstrates how to integrate RoomPlan into a UIKit-based app, allowing users to scan indoor spaces, generate accurate 3D floor plans, and visualize room layouts with ease. RoomPlanV15 focuses on simplicity and functionality, making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to incorporate room scanning and 3D modeling into their apps.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Room Scanning with RoomPlan API:**  
   - Leverages the RoomPlan API to scan rooms using the device's LiDAR sensor (or camera for non-LiDAR devices).  
   - Captures walls, doors, windows, and other architectural features in real-time.  

2. **3D Floor Plan Generation:**  
   - Converts scanned data into a detailed 3D model of the room.  
   - Displays the floor plan with accurate dimensions and structural elements.  

3. **Measurement Tools:**  
   - Provides precise measurements for walls, distances, and room areas.  
   - Allows users to interactively view and edit measurements.  

4. **Export Functionality:**  
   - Enables users to export the 3D model or floor plan as a USDZ file or image for sharing or further use.  

5. **UIKit-Based Interface:**  
   - Built entirely using UIKit, showcasing how to integrate RoomPlan into traditional iOS apps.  
   - Features a clean and intuitive user interface for scanning, viewing, and interacting with 3D models.  

6. **Room Data Storage:**  
   - Saves scanned room data locally using Core Data for future reference.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- **RoomPlan API:** For room scanning and 3D model generation.  
- **UIKit:** For building the user interface and managing app navigation.  
- **ARKit:** For augmented reality and spatial mapping.  
- **Core Data:** For local storage of scanned room data.  

**Target Audience:**  
RoomPlanV15 is designed for developers who want to explore the RoomPlan API in a UIKit-based environment. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those working on apps in real estate, interior design, architecture, or home improvement industries.  

**Learning Outcomes:**  
By working with RoomPlanV15, developers will learn:  
- How to integrate the RoomPlan API into a UIKit project.  
- Techniques for working with ARKit and LiDAR for room scanning.  
- Best practices for managing and displaying 3D models in a UIKit app.  
- How to store and retrieve scanned room data using Core Data.  

**GitHub Repository:**  
The project is available on GitHub, complete with detailed documentation, code comments, and a step-by-step guide to help developers get started quickly.  

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Support for multi-room scanning and merging.  
- Integration with furniture placement tools for interior design.  
- Advanced export options, such as PDF floor plans.  
- Cloud synchronization for scanned room data.  

RoomPlanV15 is a practical and straightforward project that highlights the power of the RoomPlan API in a UIKit-based iOS app, providing a solid foundation for developers to build innovative spatial applications.
